        <p>Hello! My name is Kazuto Tashiro and I am from Osaka, Japan. I enjoy music. I am living with my wife and two cats. I used to be a violin player. I had played jazz, pops, classic, and rock. Two years ago, I got brain infarction and after that right side of my body has been palarized, so I can use only left hand with doing most thongs even I am not a lefty. Using the PC is one thing that I can work with my situation. only slow! I am not disappointed at all. I am super happy that I can still learn a lot things. Now, I am working on rehabilitation so that I will be able to play the violin again.</p>
